		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello everyone, my name is Christian Isaac and I am a cybersecurity major here at UAlbany. I am a transfer student who is also a junior.
		Some interests that I have are sports (pretty much all of them), video games, exercising and working out, walking, sunsets, animals, and of course,
		computer related things. Some of my career goals include making a lot of money so I can enjoy my life to the fullest, becoming a streamer as a side hustle,
		opening up a cozy restaurant or a food truck when I retire, as well as becoming a strong figure in the cybersecurity field. Some of my favorite hobbies include
		playing with my dog or taking him for walks, working out and lifting weights, socializing, playing video games, playing and/or watching sports, playing chess,
		walking, and listening to music. Those are just a few of the hobbies that I enjoy partaking in. </p>
